# Vision

Rustploy is a self-hosted, fully open source platform for deploying containerized apps with low resource consumption.

## Principles

- Self-hosted first: run on one VM with no mandatory cloud dependencies.
- Resource efficient: small binaries, low memory footprint, event-driven loops.
- Open source by default: transparent roadmap, docs, and implementation.
- Safe operations: predictable deploys, rollbacks, and strong defaults.

## Non-goals for v0.1

- Kubernetes compatibility.
- Multi-region orchestration.
- Complex enterprise policy engines.
